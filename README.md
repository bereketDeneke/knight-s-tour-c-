# The knight's-tour-c-
The knight‚Äôs tour problem is to find a sequence of moves for a knight on a chessboard, such that the knight visits each square exactly one time, and comes back to his starting position. Figure 1a shows a solution on the standard 8x8 chessboard. The board will not necessarily be square: Figure 1b shows the example of a 6x6 board where the 4 corners are obstacles, and the knight must traverse all squares that are not obstacles. In some instances, there is no knight‚Äôs tour. The goal of this assignment is to write a program that solves this problem. You will have to use backtracking (see below), which is a standard technique to solve some combinatorial problems. The solution is usually implemented as a recursive algorithm, but in this assignment, you will not be allowed to use recursion. So the main procedure will be iterative, and will use a stack to records the solution currently being explored. This is a general fact about recursion: You can always replace a recursive algorithm by an iterative algorithm that uses a stack. However, it can make the program longer and more complicated.
